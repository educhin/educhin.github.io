I have just completed my Sinatra portfolio project which means I am roughly 50% through the course. As my coding skills grow, a great sense of self believe that a career as a technologist is possible for me grows along with it. Even though I work in a tech company already, imposter syndrome has been way to real and something I haven't fully been able to shake or come to terms with but, here are a few things I have learned thus far:
‚Äã
1) I can actually do this!... It is possible for me to finish coding projects on my own, even with my job and other responsibilities. 
‚Äã
‚Äã
2) I need to be more careful and more mindful of distractions... When it is time to work, my phone is seldom my friend. It's easy to lie to myself and think I'm just taking a break but those breaks have often added up to be longer than my work time. 
‚Äã
3) I should be more structured about how I approach software development... When I was playing football (soccer) I always planned out everything. My diet, stretches, workouts, skills training, everything had a purpose and nothing was wasted. I followed blogs, players, teams and watched literally every single Premier League match and the highlights. I analyzed the matches to learn more and talked about them among peers to build a deeper perspective. I even listened to the commentators and pundits and learned how they viewed and analyzed the match. Football was my passion but it only became my income because I made it my life to study it. Now I'm not saying I have to sign my soul away to software development and engineering but there is something to be learned from that focus. 
‚Äã
4) Accountability partners are wildly important for me... It is so important to have at least one voice that is going to check in and see to it that I have accomplished what I said I would. Thankfully, at the moment I have the correct people in my life  pushing and guiding my progress with their words and more so with their actions (thank you all)
‚Äã
5) I should probs be tracking my own progress more regularly and working to keep myself accountable.
‚Äã
That said, more blog posts, twitter threads, and videos to come in the future.
