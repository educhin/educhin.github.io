I have just submitted my final project for Flatiron and it is a wonderful feeling. Two months ago I landed my first dev job so the dread of trying to validate my decision to go to a bootcamp is nonexistent and I can just ride the wave of elation. 

Going into this experience I was looking for a magic pill that was going to give me coding super powers. Looking back at the experience as a whole I can say that I do not believe bootcamps are even necessary (let alone magical) but they definitely serve a purpose. For me, it got my a$$ in coding shape as the curriculum forced me to turn over stones that I would normally just walk right past and consistently put me in ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù situations. The bootcamp was also really helpful as it provided structure, order, and a starting point in this massive tech universe. 

Yes, I also learned a good bit of programming during this time but, in so many ways though, I learned much more about myself. 
I learned what interests me in tech, like Linux and sys engineering. 
I learned to speak up for myself and share my voice with the world by writing blogs and connecting with other devs on social media. 
I also learned I‚Äôm still not a fan of school üòÖ
I also know that learning never stops and now that I have finished the bootcamp I have the freedom to explore my passions further and build my own curriculum. 

To end I am so excited to be closing this chapter in my dev life, not because I want to get away from it, but because I am so excited to start writing the rest of my story. Hell...I might even keep blogging and document my adventures down the Linux rabbit hole. 

But until then‚Ä¶

See you next time Space Cowboys....
