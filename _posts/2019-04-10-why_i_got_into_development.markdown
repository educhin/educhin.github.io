Often enough, when starting a new endeavour you will eventually come across the question, “So what made you get into [insert any topic under the sun]?” This time for me is no different, but we will be covering my entry into the world of web development. To find this answer I feel we have to start off a little more broad and work our way down. 

Throughout my life, I have always been drawn to a few principles: building, creating, designing, and fixing. For a while I was drawn to architecture and wanted to create great structures to mimic the Lego skyscrapers I built as a child. Putting together cars and replacing engines in my uncle’s mechanic shop was another passion. I was also tasked with fixing anything for my parents that found its way under their roof. Lawn mowers, ceiling fans, washer machines and even the occasional window. (Mother if you are reading this I still have no idea how that ball kicked itself through your window, no idea.)

These principles are found in many fields and truly they developed my curiosity and directed my life, which in turn gave me a solid foundation in a lot of areas. However, in general, these paths I was going down led to what felt like hobbies and were not the career paths for me. Although some of these hobbies would come and go, football has always been a constant. It is a passion of mine til this day and a creative release. Bending the rules of the game and testing new skills is more than a game for me but a way of life. I was lucky enough to have a career in football and spent most of my adult life travelling around the world playing the sport I love. That was a long time dream of mine and I thought that would be my life. While my love for the game will never be altered, I realised that really this sport was allowing me the freedom to recognize my next path.

A lot of the reasons I am in this engineering path now can be attributed to my long time friend Kayla, a self taught web developer. I was back home between teams after she landed her first engineering job and we would joke about all the million dollar apps that she should build with her new entry into the world of tech. Fast forward a couple of months and 100 million dollar app ideas later we got to the question that rocked my world, “Why don’t you just build one yourself??” What I initially thought to be a jest was actually an earnest call to push me towards my passion. When I was at a loss she continued to say how she thought I was more than capable and qualified to learn. On top of that, because of my career choice I had a lot of downtime in between training sessions. We tried to narrow down what we thought would be the easiest path for my self taught journey and eventually landed on Swift as my starting point.

To be honest, initially I had some drive but that surge of energy diminished along with the novelty of learning a new skill. However, it was not something I could just walk away from, I had already been bitten by the bug. Over the next couple of years, I was in and out of the coding world working on different courses I found from YouTube to Udemy. Although my consistency at the time flickered like the light of a burning candle, one thing was for certain: the spark within me had ignited. 

What keeps me pursuing web development is that it gives me the ability to create living structures that are never complete. Development allows me to constantly polish and refine my principles: Design, Create, Build, Fix...repeat. The beauty of it all is that I have found a medium that allows me to express myself and recreate the ideas and images of my mind for the world to see.
