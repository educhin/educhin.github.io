We all love a challenge. It brings out the best in us and shows us who we really are. This challenge I am referring to is especially meaningful to me as 90 days is all I have left to complete my program to successfully graduate from flatiron (barring applying for an extension which my pocket does NOT plan on.). I have just completed my rails project so that means I have 3 sections left to complete. QUICK MATHS! That means I need to complete at least one section and one project each month for the next 3 months....let’s get it. This is what I have been preparing for and honestly, kinda what I live for. The proverbial fire has been lit underneath my @$$ and I am ready to get to work. The excitement of tackling this challenge is washing away the fears and anxiety of what happens if I don’t. I’ve come a long way in this journey so far and learned so much more than just coding.

In all honesty the reason it has taken so long (not that it’s bad to go at this pace, do you!) is because I have had to do a lot of growing mentally for my health. Previously I had been trying to force myself to work through a rut. I believed that I just wasn’t working hard enough and if I worked harder then things would just look up. The old expression of “pull yourself up by the CSS” or whatever they say. This may be true for some but for me it wasn’t. I had never even addressed why I wasn’t working hard in the first place. I took a hiatus from the program, work, and everything else to focus on myself. A topic that I had pushed aside for far too long. I realized that I was doing a lot of things mechanically with no real reason behind it. The rut I was in spanned across more than just coding. Of course, I didn’t want to code, but I also didn’t want to do anything else. After months of that I began to work more on myself and my mentality. I started practicing more self care and reading more books on bettering yourself and building better habits. More importantly I began to practice the methods in those books. Meditation became a part of my daily routine to help still my mind to allow myself to focus rather than seek out constant distractions. Slowly, ungainly, and about as steady as a two day old deer I began to come out on the other side. I am still on my growth journey and I have a lifetime to go, constantly building and reinventing myself along the way. The good news is that I see these challenges (especially the 90 day one ahead of me) as exciting growth opportunities to mold myself further into the person I see myself as. 

Accountability is key so I’ll be using this blog as my log. I have 3 more blog posts left so, I will be using them as a check in for my progress in the 90 day challenge. I am truly excited to get in on this and to see the growth that comes with it. 

Here’s a glass to Murphy. Do your worst, I plan to do my best.
