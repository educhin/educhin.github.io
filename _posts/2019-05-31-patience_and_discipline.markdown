The problem with patience and discipline is that developing each of them requires both of them. 
-Thomas M. Sterner, The Practicing Mind (2005)

I wanted to start this post off with that particular quote because patience and discipline are two things I have been lacking recently. As a self-paced online student, I realized very quickly that life on my own can be difficult and no task is more difficult than staying on task.

Just recently, I completed my first project for the Flatiron bootcamp. Initially, I would have said it took me way too long to complete and it was my inability and lack of discipline that is to blame. While that is a fair assessment, in all honesty, I believe I completed it right on time. The reason for that thought is that upon completion I have been left with a rather interesting feeling, weightlessness. The stress that was present about building this project, the anxiety about each moment when I wasn’t working and should have been, all the pressure I placed on myself began to disappear as I neared the end.Though I often feel a feeling of relief after finishing a project, this time it felt different.I realize now, that when I started this project I immediately began judging where I was in my learning process against where I wanted to be. That created a negative environment which only pushed me away from completion. Whenever I hit a snag I looked for ways to distract myself that would pull me away from my code. Things that would make me “feel better” at the time but ultimately would leave me in the same or worse position. As I continued to work through this project, I started to apply knowledge from the book I quoted earlier. As I did that, my focus shifted away from the product I was looking to produce and towards the process I was taking. I stopped judging my progress and applied that wasted energy to finding a successful route in development. I noticed that as I practiced that idea more I stopped looking for ways to distract myself and was able to stay on task. The joy was now the process and growing as a coder versus just getting it done so I could move on. By simply becoming more patient with myself, I became more disciplined in my process and ultimately produced a better product. 

Now, in no way have I perfected this idea of slowing down and focusing on the process, but I am very glad that I have become aware of this idea so early on in my career as a developer. Of course, this is a skill that I will need to continue developing but just as I am excited by the product, I am now just as excited for the process.
