I have just finished my JavaScript project which means I am only one project away from completing my flatiron curriculum. This is exciting news and what more is that I have also received an extension. This extension couldn’t have come at a better time because I have really been enjoying Javascript. I have even been doing other courses, side projects and extra reading along with my flatiron course load. Ok, ok, you can make a case that I should have been doing that anyway but the other sections just didn’t speak to me in the same way. It’s one thing to just write code but with javascript I watch it come to life (Cue maniacal laughter and lightning). 

There have been plenty of ups and downs in my journey. Bouts with imposter syndrome and existential questions like “Is this even the right path…” But my work with JavaScript has been like a breath of fresh air. It is the fun challenge I had been seeking. The language that woke me up. JS has helped me see that coding really is for me and compelled me to explore further outside the curriculum. Seeking out new coding challenges to build my repertoire. And you know what that’s called…Growth!

For instance with my JS project I set out to build a paint app because the personal projects I was pursuing had led me to animating on the canvas. I had been using a library called p5.js to accomplish this though. The library makes animating to the canvas rather simple so it was a great introduction to the design and programming concepts that I was learning but I wanted to do more for my project. I decided that I would build the application with just plain ol’ JavaScript, no libraries. It was a challenge of course but watching it come together within the project requirements was exhilarating. 

At this point in my journey JS was like an oasis in the desert and I am excited to see where my coding (and animation) career are headed after this refreshing point.
