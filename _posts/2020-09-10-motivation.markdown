Let’s talk about motivation. A while back, I decided that I wasn’t happy with my career path and I wanted to shake things up. With that in mind I signed up for the Flatiron bootcamp.

Now, we are coming into the final hours of that bootcamp and honestly, it couldn’t have come at a better time. My motivation to finish had severely decreased. A while back, when I signed up for the Flatiron program it was with the same hopeful intentions as everyone else, “finish the bootcamp and become a software developer.” Since I was already working in a tech company, this was not a crazy leap but I definitely needed some added motivation to get going in the right direction. With that goal in mind I paid my deposit and set off on the journey.  

As far as the program is concerned, I have had a very straight forward time. No real bumps or bruises to knock me off course. I diligently worked through the curriculum with the promise of dev jobs carrying me along. That was until I actually landed a dev job, months ahead of Flatiron’s schedule. It was like the carrot I had been chasing jumped off the stick and into my hand. Landing a job was a fantastic feeling and I couldn’t be happier about starting my life as a dev but, this created a problem, or more of a void. The motivation I had when I started had disappeared over night. My end goal was to become an engineer. Mission Accomplished. But what about the bootcamp? 

I started my current position in July and amidst ramping up and learning the layout of my new position I struggled to find that motivation to finish. I was feeling like the result of the bootcamp didn’t matter anymore and in some ways it didn’t. I couldn’t shake the feeling of something hanging over me though so I continued to pick away at the curriculum. Eventually as I began working on my final project that sense of duty morphed into my final motivation, freedom. Freedom to extend my legs, and take a f@#$%^g break from the bootcamp! Freedom to begin a new chapter in my dev career. Most importantly though freedom to explore without deadlines or requirements to meet.
